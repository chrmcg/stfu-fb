## Make Facebook STFU!

If you need to focus on a particular Facebook page (like a class or project that conducts group discussions on Facebook) and would rather not be distracted by notifications and chat, this extension will remove that stuff!

* No blue bar at the top (no notification alerts)
* No chat sidebar
* Just you and that sweet sweet content

## Installation
* This is a Chrome Extension, so it only works if you're visiting Facebook via Google Chrome (on desktop, not mobile)
* Download [this project as a zip file](https://github.com/chrmcg/stfu-fb/archive/master.zip), put it somewhere on your computer, and unzip it
* In Chrome, visit __chrome://extensions__ in your URL bar
  * At the top right, check the box for "Developer mode"
  * Click the "Load packed extension..." button
  * Select the unzipped directory you downloaded
  * The extension should appear in your list of extensions, with the title "STFU-FB"
  * Make sure "Enabled" is checked for this new extension
* Refresh Facebook; the top bar & chat bar should be gone
* To get back to normal, head back over to __chrome://extensions__ and disable the extension

## FAQ
* Why do I have to disable the extension? Couldn't you add a button to restore the UI to its initial state?
  * I made this in five minutes as a minimum viable distraction-remover.
  * Feel free to mess with `content.js` and send a pull request!
* Is there a license for this code?
  * You can do whatever you want: copy, paste, edit, sell, etc.
* Why not release this as a real extension on the Chrome Web Store?
  * `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
